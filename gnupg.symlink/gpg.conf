# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want to
# uncomment the following option and set your preferred keyid.
# The default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is
# the first key found in the secret keyring

# default-key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
# certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.
# This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
# Defaults to --no-require-cross-certification.  However for new
# installations it should be enabled.

require-cross-certification

# Note that future version of GnuPG will change to UTF-8 as default character set.

charset utf-8

# Some old Windows platforms require 8.3 filenames.  If your system
# can handle long filenames, uncomment this.

no-mangle-dos-filenames

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.

use-agent

######## Keyserver Options ########
###################################

# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).

#keyserver

# Common options for keyserver functions

keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url include-revoked

# Don't leak DNS, see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846

# keyserver-options no-try-dns-srv



# Automatic key location
#
# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using the
# auto-key-locate option.  This happens when encrypting to an email
# address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no
# user@example.com keys on the local keyring.  This option takes the
# arguments in the order they are to be tried

# Try CERT, then PKA, then LDAP, then hkp://keys.gnupg.net:

auto-key-locate cert pka keyserver
